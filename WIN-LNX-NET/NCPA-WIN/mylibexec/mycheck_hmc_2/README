HMC Plugin Installation
There are no plugins provided by IBM to monitor HMC and / or Power Systems, but there is a third party plugin [GPL License] developed by Ivan Bergantin:

 

http://www.bityard.org/blog/_media/2013/11/11/check_hmc.sh

 

The instructions stated here are adopted from the bityard's blog.  Minor modifications have been made to the script to handle a few error scenarios, and support the latest HMC versions. 

Download the aforementioned script, place it on the Nagios host, and provide permission to execute it.

$ sudo cp /tmp/check_hmc.sh /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_hmc.sh

Perform the following steps to create an SSH key pair between Nagios host and HMCs it will monitor:

1. Create a SSH key for nagios:
# su - nagios
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hmc

3. Copy the public key from the above generated key to HMC which need to be monitored:
# scp /home/nagios/.ssh/id_rsa_hmc.pub hscroot@<hmc_ip_address>:~/

4. Log into the HMC and copy the public key to the appropriate location by running the following command:
$ mkauthkeys -a "`cat id_rsa_hmc.pub`"

The above steps establishes SSH key based authentication between an HMC and the Nagios host.

To verify things are working as expected run the following command from the Nagios host:
# su - nagios
$ ssh hscroot@<hmc_ip_address> "lshmc -V"

The above command should run on the specified HMC without asking for a password.

Note: The assumption is that ssh is installed and configured in the Ubuntu Server Edition host, and ssh enabled on the HMC(s).

HMC Plugin Setup

The plug-in configuration files are located in the /etc/nagios-plugins/config directory.

1. Create a file named “check_hmc.cfg” in /etc/nagios-plugins/config directory

2. The config file defines the command object types, and you can define various command abstractions here which will inturn be using the check_hmc.sh plugin. For example:

# check HMC rmc processes
define command {
       command_name    check_hmc_rmc
       command_line    $USER1$/check_hmc.sh -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C rmc -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$ -a $ARG3$
}

# check HMC System Attention LED for physical system
define command {
       command_name    check_hmc_ledphys
       command_line    $USER1$/check_hmc.sh -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C ledphys
}

# check HMC serviceable events
define command {
        command_name    check_hmc_events
        command_line    $USER1$/check_hmc.sh -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C events
}

3. Define the “host” object type. You need to create or edit /etc/nagios3/conf.d/localhost.cfg file (on some systems this file maybe called localhost_nagios2.cfg) by adding the following entry:

define host {
    use        generic-host
    host_name  <hmc hostname>
    alias      <Alias for HMC hostname>
    address    <IP Address of HMC>
}
“generic-host” is a template. You can specify your own templates as well. The default “generic-host” template is located in “/etc/nagios3/conf.d/generic-host.cfg” (on some systems this file maybe called generic-host_nagios2.cfg)

 

4. Define the “hostgroup” object type. You need to create or edit /etc/nagios3/hostgroups.cfg (on some systems this file maybe called hostgroups_nagios2.cfg)

define hostgroup {
    hostgroup_name    HMC
    alias             Hardware Management Console
    members           <List of HMC Hostnames>
}

5. Define the “services” object type. You need to create or edit the /etc/nagios3/conf.d/localhost.cfg file. For example, to monitor the Power system LED status.

    
    # check_hmc_ledvlpar
    define service {
        use                     generic-service
        hostgroup_name          hmc
        service_description     Check_SA_LED_physical
        check_command           check_hmc_ledphys
    }

“generic-service” is a template. You can specify your own service template as well. The default “generic-service” template is located in “/etc/nagios3/conf.d/generic-service.cfg” (on some systems this file maybe called generic-service_nagios2.cfg)
 

Once the above steps are completed, restart Nagios to load the plugin and config changes:

1. Run a configuration check and if successful reload the Nagios process:
    $ /usr/sbin/nagios3 -v /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg

2. Reload/Restart the nagios server.
    $ /etc/init.d/nagios3 reload

Note:
check_hmc.sh can be modified to perform additional operations. Users can come up with their own scripts and plugins for Nagios to perform additional monitoring / operations. This check plugin is a simple shell script, and users can write this plugin in any programming language like Python, Java, C, etc.,

 

Monitoring the HMC in Nagios:
As mentioned earlier, Nagios monitors two types of Object:

Host; HMC is a host in this case
Service; Services are particular functions associated with a Host. Every Power System entity that we want to monitor will be treated as a service here. For e.g. Attention LED status of a Physical Server or Logical Partition is a service.
Nagios provides a basic graphical user interface (GUI) through which users can visualize the states of the resources that they are monitoring. The GUI is a Web application and need to be launched from a browser.

Launch "http://<ip address of Nagios server>:port/nagios3 in a web browser
At the user ID prompt enter "nagiosadmin".  The password is the one provided while installing the Nagios server.
